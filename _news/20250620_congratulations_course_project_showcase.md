description: 'Congratulations to the undergrads mentored by our group for cleaning up at the “Rational Design of Soft Matter Based on AI” project showcase. The team of Ye Kuang(邝晔), Qiyuan Wang(王齐远), Mengqian Sun (孙梦倩), DongluoWu (吴东洛), Weixi Deng (邓维熙) and Xinyi Zhou (周心怡) coached by Xian together with TAs Yan Sui(隋岩), Xiaohan Wei (韦骁汉) and Xueying Yuan (袁雪迎) took First Prize (1st out of 10). Another of team — Kai Peng (彭凯), Zhiying Luo (罗芷滢), Wanjie Xiao (肖婉洁), Zixuan Zhang (张子轩), Tianyu Xu (徐天羽) and Junfeng Xian (冼峻峰) claimed Third Prize. Over the semester they built molecular-dynamics models, ran large-scale simulations under varied conditions, logged the resulting sequence–interaction data into a custom database, and applied machine-learning algorithms to uncover how sequence patterns drive molecular interactions. A round of applause for their hard work and sharp thinking. May the skills they forged in this course keep opening doors in the years ahead!'
